                <ul>
                    <li class="oInformationGrey">Items From Home<br />We encourage parents / carers to let their child bring any item which is used as a comforter (e.g. blanket, teddy, dummy etc) with them to nursery to help them feel secure. However, could we please request that you refrain from bringing large toys or items of value. We ask that sweets are saved for home.</li>
                    <li>Clothing<br />As we provide a varied curriculum including baking, painting, gardening, clay activities etc.. it is important that children are dressed appropriately so that they feel comfortable participating. Aprons are always provided for such activities but it is inevitable that clothing will become soiled when children are enjoying themselves.</li>
                    <li class="oInformationGrey">Footwear<br />As many activities will involve children sitting and crawling on the floor area we ask that parents and carers provide a pair of indoor footwear (e.g. slippers). During wet weather children will still have the opportunity to access the outdoor play facilities and so wellington boots are a practical addition!</li>
                    <li>Settling In<br />We understand that young children need time to adapt to a new setting and adjust to new faces and routines. Many children prefer to watch and listen from the sidelines before they feel secure enough to become involved. The settling in period is vital and is given high priority. With this in mind we encourage parents/carers to stay with their child in they wish, helping them to settle so that everyone is comfortable and happy with their new environment. We hope that this will make the transition into nursery a positive experience for everyone.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Other Items<br />After lunch all the children will be encouraged to brush their teeth and wash their hands and face. We will provide a towel and flannel for each child in a labelled wash bag. We ask parents to provide a named toothbrush for their childs use. During hot weather we ask that children have their own sun hat and suncream.</li>
                    <li class="oInformationGrey">Suncream<br />The nursery has CCTV cameras in operation 24 hours a day to ensure the safety of children and staff on the premises. All entrances to the nursery have security keypads which means that only members of staff are able to gain access to the main areas of the nursery. All parents/carers are asked to supply a 'password' which can be used by anyone authorised to collect their child. Under no circumstances will a child be allowed to leave the nursery without the relevant password being given.</li>
                    <li>Working With You<br />We know that leaving a child at nursery for the first time is not easy, but we try and make it a bit easier. We ensure there is every opportunity to talk to staff at the nursery, enabling us to answer any questions or queries you may have. We value parents and carers thoughts and opinions and welcome feedback. Open evenings are an opportunity to discuss the development of your child in more depth with staff, or you may prefer to arrange a meeting at an alternative time if you are unable to attend. Parents and carers are always welcome to come into the nursery and share some time with their child whenever they wish.</li>
